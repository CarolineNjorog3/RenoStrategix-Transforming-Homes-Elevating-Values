        "CasaCrafters aims to revolutionize the way homeowners approach renovations by providing data-driven advice on how specific home improvements impact property values. The primary challenge is to assist homeowners in making informed decisions about renovations that yield the highest return on investment. To achieve this objective, we will use multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales data in the King County area. Our focus is not just on increasing value but also on enhancing the overall appeal for potential buyers.\n",
